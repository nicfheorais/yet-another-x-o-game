# Thinking in React Recap

## Noughts and Crosses

### Remind me about Computational Thinking

-   Understand the problem
-   Break things down into sub-problems
-   Look for patterns and generalise
-   Make a model of the real world
-   Write an algorithm
-   Translate into code

### Play some games of noughts and crosses

Find an [online version for them to play](https://playtictactoe.org/), or just a [collaborative drawing app like Zoom Whiteboard](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-whiteboard/)

### Play another, write down everything that happens step by step

-   Draw a 3x3 grid of squares
-   Pick a player to go first
-   Pick a value (X)
-   Pick a square
    -   if the square is not empty, you can't pick it
    -   if the square is empty, you can pick it
-   Check if someone has won
    -   if someone won, the game ends and they are declared the winner
-   Next player
-   Pick a value (O)
-   Pick a square
    -   if the square is not empty, you can't pick it
    -   if the square is empty, you can pick it
-   Check if someone has won
-   Next player (X)
-   ...
-   Someone won, game ends

### Look for patterns in these steps

Player Move:

-   Pick a square
    -   if the square is not empty, you can't pick it
    -   if the square is empty, you can pick it
-   Check if someone has won
    -   if someone won, the game ends and they are declared the winner
-   Next player

### Model to represent the aspects we need

-   Players - X or O
-   Board - `[]`, `[[]]`, `string`, `number` if you really wanted (each number represents a possible board state)

\*There are 9 positions and an alphabet with 3 letters (X, O, empty). Total number of possible combinations is 3^9 = 19683. There are 5477 possible legal game states.

### Plan -> Algorithm

-   Draw a 3x3 grid of squares
-   First player is X
-   Player Move:
-   Choose a square
    -   if the square is not empty, you can't pick it
    -   if the square is empty, you can pick it - put the player symbol in that square
-   Check if someone has won
    -   how?
    -   if they won, game over
    -   if not, next player move

### Remind me about Thinking in React

State, behaviour, dependencies, show -> State, functions, props, render

### React Plan

Wireframe. View parts. Behaviour parts.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |
|     |     |     |

`Your turn: X`

---

Goes to these components:

-   Game
    -   State
        -   `board = [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null] <- "X", "O", or null`
        -   `x's turn = true | false`
    -   Behaviour
        -   make a move
            -   if the square is not empty, you can't pick it
            -   if the square is empty, you can pick it - put the player symbol in that square
        -   check winner
            -   check if there's matching symbols in rows, columns, or diagonals
            -   if there is, the game ends and the symbol wins
            -   if the board is full, the game ends as a draw
    -   Render
        -   Board
        -   Who's turn is it?
        -   Winner
-   Board
    -   Props
        -   board
        -   make a move
    -   Render
        -   Squares - 1 for each item in board, arranged into a grid
-   Square
    -   Props
        -   make a move
    -   Render
        -   `"", X, or O`
