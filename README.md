# Yet another Xs and Os Game

## Summary

#### `Current MVP`:

Created this to continue my practice with React with basic React Hooks and State, along with HTML, CSS and Javascript

#### `Project Backlog`:

-   Migrate to Typescript

## Artifacts

### Project Setup

Four main components rendered:

-   Game - for the overall game. This contains much of the business logic, including a function, kept in its own file (check4Winner.js)

-   GameInfo - to cover the infomrations messages rendered at the top, such as the App name, which player is next, or, if the game is over, whether it's a draw, of if there was a winner, and, when the game is over, a button to allow people to play again

-   Board

-   Square

### Supporting Documentation

-   In DrawIO, a [wireframe of the solution](./sinead-wireframe.drawio) , highlighting the components that will be required to build them, and how they are nested:

-   Some of [my markdown notes](./sinead-notes.md) from planning session run by School of Code (chris Meah) on how to apply computational thinking to developing the application
